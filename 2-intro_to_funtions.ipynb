    "## Defining a function\n",
    "\n",
    "Defining a function in Python happens by using the `def` keyword followed by the name of the function itself. When defining a function, you must ensure to follow this checklist:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A function is defined in Python by the `def` and followed by the function name\n",
    "2. A function name must be written in lower case letters only\n",
    "3. Any spaces within the function name should be noted by an underscore \"_\"\n",
    "4. A function name can NOT start with a number or special character\n",
    "5. The function name must end with `():` and have it's \"body\" indented below it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining an empty function\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you may want to write some comments about what your function should do and how you want to create your functions behavior. With that said you may want to create a function within your script that does nothing and have it as a place holder to ensure you don't forget it. Which happens more often than I'd like to admit."
